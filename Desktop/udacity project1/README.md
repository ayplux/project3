### Project Title
US- Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project was part of udacity's Programming for Data Science for Enterprise.

The project entail using of python to explore data that are related to a bikeshare systems for three major cities in US-Chicago, New York City, and Washigton. I wrote code to import and answer questions about it. I also wrote a script that takes raw input to vreate an interactive experience in the terminal to present the statistics. 



Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project i uncover bike usage patterns.
